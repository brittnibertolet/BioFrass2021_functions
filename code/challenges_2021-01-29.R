### Challenge 1:

# In the data directory, you will find 5 csv (comma-separated values) files. 
# Each file corresponds to water temperature data from a different lake at UNDERC, 
# where the LakeID corresponds to the two letter ID in the file name. Write a 
# custom function to calculate the average water temperature of each lake at some 
# depth. We want to use this function for multiple different lakes and different
# depths, so write the function so that the LakeID and depth are passed as 
# arguments. Return a dataframe with one row and three columns.

### Challenge 2:

# Modify your custom function from Challenge 1 to calculate the average water 
# temperature of every lake in the data directory. Hint 1: Pass the directory 
# name as an argument. Hint 2: Use a for loop to loop through every lake in the 
# directory.
